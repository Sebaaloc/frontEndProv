## What is the project:

This is a simple UI that consumes a medical courses information endpoint and shows its information on two pages "courses" which contains the information of the offered courses and "providers" contains the information of the course providers.

## How to run the project:

To run the project follow these steps:  
- Install node.  
- clone the project in your computer.  
- Open the project with your favorite IDE and run the command npm install.  
- Use npm start to execute the program.  

## Future work  

Future work in the project will be to filter results by a text input of both courses and providers, to allow narrowing results with checkboxes and finally add pagination.  

## Things to keep in mind  

The images related to the information provided by the endpoint are broken therefore running the project will result on showing an empty image.
